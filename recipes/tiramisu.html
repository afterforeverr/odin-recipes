                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with<br> 
                parchment paper.</li><br>

            <li>In a medium bowl, whip egg yolks and 1/4 cup of sugar with an electric <br>
                mixer until thick and pale. In a separate bowl, whip egg whites (with<br>
                clean beaters) to soft peaks. Gradually sprinkle in the remaining 1/2<br>
                cup sugar while whipping to medium stiff peaks. Fold the egg yolk<br>
                mixture into the egg whites. Gently fold in the flour and 1 teaspoon<br>
                vanilla. The batter should be thick and pale yellow.</li><br>

            <li>Trace two 9 inch circles onto the parchment paper using a cake pan as<br>
                a guide. Spread or pipe batter to completely fill inside the lines of the<br> 
                circles. Batter should be about 1/2 inch tall.</li><br>

            <li>Load the remaining batter into a pastry bag fitted with a half inch tip or<br>
                hole. Draw parallel lines onto another piece of parchment that are 3<br> 
                inches apart. Pipe the batter back and forth just between the lines in a<br> 
                compressed S motion, until you run out of batter. This is the part that<br>
                wraps around the outside of the cake. (It helps to have it in one piece,<br>
                but you can pipe individual fingers using the guidelines drawn on the<br>
                paper, if you prefer.) There may be extra.</li><br>

            <li>Bake in preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes, until firm but not browned.<br>
                Remove from the oven and dust generously with confectioners' sugar.<br>
                Set aside to cool.</li><br>

            <li>To make the syrup, stir together 1 cup sugar, boiling water, coffee and<br>
                1/4 cup rum until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.</li><br>
         
            <li>To make the filling, combine mascarpone, 2 cups confectioners' sugar,<br>
                dark rum and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a large bowl. Whisk together until<br> 
                completely smooth, scraping the bottom of the bowl to remove any<br>
                lumps. Gradually whisk in the heavy cream. Whip with an electric mixer<br> 
                until soft peaks form. Stop whipping when the mixture shows the first<br>
                sign of graininess.</li><br>
                
            <li>To assemble, line the sides of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment<br> 
                or waxed paper. Place one of the ladyfinger rounds in the bottom of the<br>
                pan. Brush generously, but do not soak completely, with syrup. Place<br>
                the 3-inch high ladyfinger strips around the inside edge of the pan, so<br>
                that the sides are completely covered. Brush generously with syrup.</li><br>

            <li>Spread half of the filling mixture over the first ladyfinger round in the<br>
                pan. Place the remaining ladyfinger round on top of the filling. Soak the<br>
                second ladyfinger round with syrup until it cannot take any more.<br>
                Spread the remaining filling over that and smooth the top. Sprinkle<br>
                with grated chocolate. Refrigerate at least 4 hours.</li><br>

            <li>To serve, remove the sides of the pan and carefully remove the<br>
                parchment or waxed paper from the outside of the cake. Dust with<br>
                confectioners' sugar just before serving.</li><br>
